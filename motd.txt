Get ready to explore all the new things in this brand new update. It seems as though forest has gone back to its original state! with its leaves back and even some new platforms to hop around on! I also hear something coming from mountains, do you? sounds like the new "Let it Snow" soundtrack!

Make sure not to miss it, maybe type it out on the new tech cosmetics! From phones to laptops to even a virtual reality headset! these cosmetics are sure to make you look stylish. But you arent the only thing looking stylish, as the shop took on a new look! with brand new blue lights to fit the tech theme!

It also seems that the world has shrunken by 25% to make traveling easier, thank you gods of boredom land!
