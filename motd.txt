Welcome to the brand new Boredom Land Update!
Time for some camping and new adventures, and with the return of the Jungle Map, you are sure to have a great time! Go visit the jungle map and explore and find hidden secrets that have been locked away for thousands of years! Not only that, but the Mountains map has opened up again! it looks a bit different however, weird.
Try on some of the brand new Camping Trip Cosmetics, or maybe some of the new Holiday, 4th of july themed cosmetics! It seems as the world is stuck in nighttime, for you to enjoy the firework show. Go try out the new 4th of july cosmetics as they will only be here for 7 Days
If it starts to get too hot around the campfire, and you start sweating, what better way to cool, then water balloons! thats right! there is a giant bucket in forest, go grab some water balloons from there and throw them at eachother
Have fun, and find as many secrets as you can!
