It's now the time of year where we give our thanks, and we give the gift of a new update

The meebs of the Boredom World are super excited to share their new Thanksgiving experience. Halloween is now over and there are some new things that you need to check out

There are a whole bunch of brand new Thanksgiving cosmetics for you to wear and mess around with. There also seems to be a new building in cities, not sure what's that's gonna be used for

There are also some new and old decorations prepared gor this holiday so make sure to mess around with those

Have fun and Happy Thanksgiving!
