Hello Everyone of Boredom Land, this is Goob (the main and only developer) with some big news

For all of those wondering, yes i am working on the remake and the reason there has been no updates is because i havent been able to prove my dev account on meta. Luckily this should happen very soon and boredom land will be back up.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE subscribe to the boredom land youtube channel for more info, if you wanna know ANYTHING go to that channel

Thank you, and see you guys soon
